**(2) While-Listening Activity**
- **Gradio TTS App**: Convert the text to an audio file for listening practice.
- **Gradio Cloze Question App**: Create cloze questions with blanks for past tense verbs to focus on grammar.
- **Gradio Verb Base Form App**: Students input past tense verbs they heard and get their base forms.

**(3) After-Listening Activity: Sequence the Story**
- **Gradio Image Sequencing App**: Provide images related to the story and let students arrange them in the correct sequence.

#### 2.Writing Activity

- **Gradio Writing Checker App**: Provide a prompt and allow students to write and check their writing.

**<Synopsis>**
In Echo Ridge, a mountain village enriched with legends of the "Guardian of the Glen" eagle, adventurous Alex discovers an ancient map in a library book that hints at a hidden treasure in Whispering Hollow cave. Along with friends Mia and Sam, Alex embarks on a challenging expedition through dense forests and rugged terrain. Upon reaching the cave, they find not gold, but historical artifacts including a statuette of the Guardian eagle, which they donate to the local museum. This discovery not only cements their status as local heroes but revitalizes the village's interest in its own lore and history, continuing the legend of the Guardian as a symbol of adventure and cultural heritage.
